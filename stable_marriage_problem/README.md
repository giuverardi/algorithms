# Stable Marriage Problem

## Description
This project implements the Gale-Shapley algorithm to solve the stable marriage problem. The algorithm is used to find a stable match between two groups (men and women) based on their preferences.

## Functionality
- **Generation of preferences:** Preferences can be entered manually or randomly generated.
- **Execution of the Gale-Shapley algorithm:** The algorithm finds a stable match based on provided by preferences.
- **Exporting results:** The matches found can be exported to an excel file for analysis and a txt file for reuse via code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher (not specified)
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `random`, `copy`

## Usage
1. Download the main.py and stable_marriage.py files to the same folder.
2. Run main.py
3. If the code has formed stable couples, it will return the following message: "The couples are stable, great job :) you can check the output, if you want." You will find an excel file and a txt file for checking.
4. If the code returns the following message, please contact me: "The couples are not stable :( check the output." -- because there is a bug :)
